# Personal Rail Travel App - Front End

## Introduction
* Do you wish you had an app you could just look at and it would immediately tell you the times of the trains for your commute to home or work and whether you'll be late? 
* Do you wish you could also look at the times of the trains when you next visit your friends, loved ones or relatives at the weekend?
* Are you frustrated with the performance of the trains on your regular commute and want to know how often your train is late?

    This app could be for you!

This is a project created for rail users to personalise their individual's transport needs. It is designed so that the end user can set up his or her route between two stations and schedule the times and directions according to when they travel.

More than one route can be set up to accommodate different journeys to different destinations. For example, one could set up a route to work in the morning, a route from work in the evening and a route to see their relatives at the weekend. 

A performance table is also kept as a record for train punctuality, where a user can look to see how often their train is on time.
